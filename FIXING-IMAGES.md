# Fixing Image Issues in the Portfolio Project

The application is trying to load several images from the `/assets/` directory but can't find them.

## Required Steps:

1. **Ensure the assets directory exists**:
   ```
   mkdir -p public/assets
   ```

2. **Add the following image files to the public/assets directory**:
   - barba.jpeg
   - josh.jpeg
   - roland.jpeg
   - eu.jpeg
   - rafael.jpeg
   - will.jpeg

3. **Alternative: Generate placeholder images**:
   If you don't have the actual images, you can run the utility script to generate placeholders:
   ```
   node src/utils/generatePlaceholderImages.js
   ```

4. **Verify image references in components**:
   Make sure any component referencing these images is using the correct path:
   - Correct: `/assets/imagename.jpeg` (when the image is in `public/assets/`)
   - Incorrect: `assets/imagename.jpeg` (missing leading slash)

Remember that in Next.js:
- Static files should be placed in the `public` directory
- When referencing files in the `public` directory, use URLs starting with `/`
- For better image optimization, consider using the `next/image` component instead of HTML `<img>` tags

## Using next/image (recommended):

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image';

// Using the Image component
<Image src="/assets/barba.jpeg" width={300} height={200} alt="Description" />
```
